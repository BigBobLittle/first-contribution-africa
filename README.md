## FIRST CONTRIBUTION AFRICA 
Often atimes i find it very heart-breaking, the number of contributions of my fellow Africans towards open source projects.   
After a few research, i came to realize that most people are very informed and misguided on how to contribute to open sources projects.   
They always feel its very difficult, which isn't the case. I created this repo to provide a guide to intrested individuals on the basics   
of contributing to open source projects, basically,   __fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request__ workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor.
